# GroupProject21
MTU Group Project for 2021

MediAI consits of 4 domain of computer science AI, App development, WebApp and blockchain. The app or webapp takes in patient's medical data. There is a doctor's portal as well who can submit medical reports of his/her patient. Using the medical data, AI integrated with it makes prediction whether the patient is prone to diabeties, alzheimer's or heart disease. Blockchain was used as  payment method where crypto currency was used to pay. 

I was involved in the AI side of the project.
